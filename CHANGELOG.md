# v2.0.0
* I was working pretty hard on this version so I forgot to keep track on most of the changes. Treat this as a new
  iteration of the plugin. Not many features have changed on the surface, although under the hood, the plugin has been
  completely re-programmed from the ground up. It has fixed a major bug reported by Cantibra. It will attempt to migrate
  your old data file, although I have not tested if this actually works. Please note that a significant change that you
  will experience is that the syntax for using the create comman's options (e.g. 'generate structures' and all that) is
  different in PW 2 (easier to use now).
* Hope you enjoy!
