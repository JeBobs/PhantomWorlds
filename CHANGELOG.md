# v2.0.0
* ahh... what a relief to get this released!
* I was working pretty hard on this version so I forgot to keep track on most of the changes. Treat this as a new
  iteration of the plugin. Not many features have changed on the surface, although under the hood, the plugin has been
  completely re-programmed from the ground up. It has fixed a major bug reported by Cantibra, where nether and end
  worlds were not generating properly upon a server restart. It will attempt to migrate your old data file, although I
  have not tested if this actually works. Please note that a significant change that you will experience is that the
  syntax for using the create comman's options (e.g. 'generate structures' and all that) is different in PW 2 (easier to
  use now).
* Totalled 15 hours on the development timer. Also want to note that the previous update on this plugin was 9 months
  ago! Sorry for such a delay.
* My holidays have just ended, so response times are going to be limited to my evenings again.
* Any issues, questions, suggestions, bugs and whatnot - feel free

* If you like this update, I would appreciate a kind review! ;)
