# PhantomWorlds To-do List
Ordered from first to last to be completed:
* Translate backslash character in world names as a space so world names with a space can be used in the plugin
* Files reload subcommand
* Vanish compatibility
    * don't send 'by' messages unless the sender is not a player / target can see the (player) sender
    * add vanish compatibility to 'teleport' subcommand
    * add ability to toggle vanish compatibility
    * log in console (LogLevel:INFO) when a command is prevented due to a target player seemingly being vanished to the command sender.
* Consider creating a world management GUI.
